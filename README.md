# MobSFScan

[MobSFScan](https://github.com/MobSF/mobsfscan) is a static analysis tool (SAST) that can find insecure code patterns in your Android and iOS source code.  
Supports Java, Kotlin, Android XML, Swift and Objective-C Code.  
It uses [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) static analysis rules.

This [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io/) step will:
- run MobSFScan to audit your mobile app
- generate a report 

MobSFScan is compliant with LGPL-3.0, meaning you can use this tool in your project, even if your project is proprietary or commercial.

## Usage

### Basic integration

Open `bitrise.yml` to edit your workflow:
1. Add a step to reference this repository.  
Later you can customize some options from the side panel in the UI editor.
2. Add `deploy-to-bitrise-io` to save the report generated by this step.

```yml
- git::https://github.com/OhMyApp/bitrise-step-mobsfscan.git@main: {}
- deploy-to-bitrise-io@2: {}
```

### Full workflow recipe

Copy-paste this `security_audit` workflow in your `bitrise.yml`:

```yml
security_audit:
  steps:
  - activate-ssh-key@4:
      run_if: '{{getenv "SSH_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY" | ne ""}}'
  - git-clone@8.4: {}
  - git::https://github.com/OhMyApp/bitrise-step-mobsfscan.git@main:
      title: 'MobSFScan'
      inputs:
      - project_path: "."
      - project_type: ios
      - report_file_path: "$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR/mobsfscan-report.txt"
      - output_format: txt
      - multiprocessing: default
      - fail_on_warning: 'no'
      - no_fail: 'yes'
  - deploy-to-bitrise-io@2: {}
```

### Configure options

Configuration information is available in the [MobSFScan repository](https://github.com/MobSF/mobsfscan).

You will be able to:
- ignore some rules
- choose the report format (txt, json, sonarqube, sarif, html)
- choose severity level if you wish to break the CI
